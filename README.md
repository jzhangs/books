# Books

An ebook reader to read txt files save in sdcard of KaiOS devices.

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn push
```

Please make sure there're txt files in sdcard.
**LSK 'open' to open txt files won't work now** as modification in `File Manager` is needed.

Only UTF-8 and GBK encoding are supported (using a silly guess algorithm).
